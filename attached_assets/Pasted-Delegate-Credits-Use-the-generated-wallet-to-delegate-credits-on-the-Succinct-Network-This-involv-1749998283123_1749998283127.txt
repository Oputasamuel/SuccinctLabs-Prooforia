Delegate Credits:
Use the generated wallet to delegate credits on the Succinct Network. This involves interacting with the Succinct Network’s API or smart contracts to allocate a fixed amount of credits (e.g., 10 credits) to the user’s wallet.

Example command (inspired by the video): RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- --execute to set up the wallet and delegate credits.

Ensure the credits are sufficient for minting and proving NFTs, as per your marketplace’s requirements.
NFT Minting and Proving
Upload Art and Specify Editions:
Users upload their digital art (JPEG, PNG, GIF) via a frontend interface (e.g., React with react-dropzone).

Users specify the number of NFT editions (e.g., 1 for unique, 10 for limited editions) and provide metadata (title, description).

Store the art file and thumbnail on IPFS using ipfs-http-client for decentralized access.
Mint NFT with Test Token:
When a user clicks “Mint NFT,” trigger a backend process to mint the NFT on a testnet (e.g., Ethereum Sepolia or Flow Testnet) using the user’s wallet and test tokens.

Use the test token (e.g., a dummy ERC-20 token) to pay for minting costs. The amount (e.g., 10 test tokens) is deducted from the user’s wallet balance.

Example smart contract interaction (Ethereum):
solidity
function mintNFT(address recipient, uint256 editionCount, string memory tokenURI) public {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= mintCost * editionCount, "Insufficient balance");
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= mintCost * editionCount;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < editionCount; i++) {
        _mint(recipient, totalSupply++);
        _setTokenURI(totalSupply - 1, tokenURI);
    }
}
Ensure the minting process is verified by SP1 to prove the transaction’s integrity.
Generate SP1 Proof for Minting:
Use SP1 to generate a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) for the minting transaction. This proves that the NFT was minted correctly without revealing sensitive data (e.g., wallet balance, art file).

Run the SP1 prover CLI in your backend:
bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- --prove
The proof generation process includes:
Compiling the Rust program that defines the minting logic.

Executing the program to generate the proof.

Verifying the proof to ensure it’s valid.
Store the proof artifact (e.g., proof ID, size, verification time) on IPFS or in your database.
Verify Proof:
After minting, verify the SP1 proof to confirm the transaction’s validity. This can be done on-chain or off-chain.

Example verification command (inspired by the video):
bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- --verify
Display the verification result to the user (e.g., “Proof Verified Successfully!” with a confetti animation).
Marketplace Trading
List NFT for Sale:
Users list their minted NFTs for sale at a specified price (in test tokens).

The listing process is also verified by SP1 to prove ownership and price integrity.

Store the listing details (NFT ID, price, seller’s wallet address) in your database.
Buy or Bid on NFTs:
Users browse the marketplace and select NFTs to buy or bid on.

When a user buys an NFT, deduct the test tokens from their wallet and transfer ownership via the smart contract.

Generate an SP1 proof for the transaction to ensure fairness and privacy.

Verify the proof before finalizing the trade.
Update User Credits:
After each minting or trading action, update the user’s delegated credits on the Succinct Network.

Ensure the user has sufficient credits for future actions, prompting them to delegate more if needed.
Community and Sharing
Share on X:
After minting or purchasing an NFT, provide a “Share on X” button.

Use the X API to post a precomposed tweet with the NFT thumbnail, proof ID, and a link to the marketplace, tagging Succinct Labs (e.g., “I minted my ZK-powered NFT on [Platform]!  Check it out: [link] #SuccinctLabs”).

This boosts community engagement and visibility for Succinct Labs.
View Proof Details:
Display SP1 proof metadata (e.g., proof size, generation time) for each minted or traded NFT.

Educate users on how SP1 ensures transaction security without revealing private data.
Contribute to Open Source:
Host the project on Succinct Labs’ GitHub, inviting the community to contribute features like new proof types or marketplace enhancements.

Link to Succinct’s Discord for discussions and support.
